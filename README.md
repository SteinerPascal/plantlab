Setup for the plant lab for a MSE Semesterassignment in plant electrophysiology

This is the central repo connecting an experimental setup to measure plant electrophysiology for a semester thesis. The Goal of the Setup is to make it easier for hobby scientists or makers to pick up the most important aspects and get them going quickly. An image of the architecture can be found below:

## Setup
This setup consisted of two parts. The first is for measuring plant signals and the second for the environmental data.

## Plant side
This setup used an ESP32 Devkit1 connected to an 16Bit ADC1115. The ADC1115 does differential measurements on a single plant. It uses electrodes made of copper with a silver mantle. Tests have been done with accupuncture needles made from stainless steel. Make sure your electrodes are within 0.4mm in diameter.

### ADC1x15
An ADC with a lower resolution such as the 12Bit ADC1110 could also be enough but you would need to go for a gain of at least 8x. 12Bit on a gain of 8x means that the LSB is 0.25mV. The signal expected electrophysiological changes are in a range of 10-50mV. So 0.25mV as the smallest recognizable change should be enough. Be aware though: In my tests i measured a drop in voltage the higher i set the gain. A gain of 8 already halfed the signal. That's why I chose a 16Bit ADC (16Bit,gainx1 means LSB is 0.125mV).

### ESP32
The ESP32 was connected over the USB UART connection to a Raspberry Pi. The Low Pass filter is set on 10Hz since all the interesting signals are going to be below it. Note: The Filter can also be staged. the sampling time can be adjusted in the Adafruit ADC Library [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ADS1X15/blob/master/Adafruit_ADS1X15.cpp#L52) but keep the [nyquist rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate) in mind. 

## Environment side
For environmental data logging a Arduino Nano 33 Sense was used. It implements a watchdog function to keep the recording alive in case anything goes wrong. Currently it logs temperature, hummidity, light and pressure. It was connected via USB UART to a Raspberry Pi.

## Raspberry Pi
Two python scripts were running on the RPi. Both of them implement a simple producer-consumer pattern with a thread safe queue. They send the data to an InfluxDB 1.8 (InfluxDB 2.0 requires a 64xbit system). On the InfluxDB1.8 data can be visualized with grafana or chronograf. 
To start the script: ```nohup python3 -u [scriptname]```


## Some useful Stuff
- check for USB ports: `ps -ef | grep tty`
- check for USB ports with python serial lib: `python3 -m serial.tools.miniterm`
- check which pythonscripts are running: `ps -aef | grep python`
- Continous query on Influx for data aggregation: `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY cq_mv_avg ON plant_raw_01_06 RESAMPLE EVERY 1h FOR 1h BEGIN SELECT mean(value) INTO plant_raw_01_06.forever.avg_mv_value FROM plant_raw_01_06.oneday.mv GROUP BY time(10s) END`
- WIFI setup add your credentials: 

```
etc/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicant.conf 
higher priority: etc/network/interfaces.file 
```
